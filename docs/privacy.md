Sunny does **not** collect:

- Usernames or Discord IDs
- Direct Messages
- Unrelated message history
- Any other personal identifiers

## 2. How the Data Is Used

## 3. Data Retention

## 5. User Rights

- If you are a Discord server owner or moderator, you may delete stored data originating from your server using slash commands, removing Sunny from your server, or emailing sunnybot@macver.org.
- End users should contact the server administrator if they have concerns, as Sunny does not store identifiable information.

## 6. Security

- Reasonable measures are taken to secure stored data, including access controls and encryption in transit.
